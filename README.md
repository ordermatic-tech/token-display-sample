**Ordermatic Relay is the smart display system for the Ordermatic ecosystem. It serves as the critical visual link between our backend, the restaurant's kitchen, and their customers.**

This project is the visual front-end designed to run on any smart display (TVs, tablets, etc.). It currently handles the two most critical functions: customer order initiation (QR) and status notification (Token Display).

## üöÄ The Vision

The core mission of **Ordermatic Relay** is to be the perfect connection point between two worlds: the controlled chaos of the kitchen and the eager anticipation of the guest.

This software is the **digital handshake** that closes that gap. It takes the signal of a freshly prepared order and transforms it into a clear, calming notification for the customer. It's the final, crucial "baton pass" in the service race, ensuring the journey is seamless, efficient, and stress-free for everyone involved.
